                <h2>About our (fictional) client Studentpartiet</h2>
                <p>Studentpartiet is a new Norwegian political party, fighting for students' interests. The party was founded this year, by students getting tired of not getting their voices heard. The party is a pro-academia and has students as their main target demographics, but is open for everyone with pro-academic political views. The party is positioning itself for the next election and need a website to make their political views easily available to the public.</p>
                <h3>Our (fictional) contact person: Ragnhild Kristensen</h3>
                <p>Ragnhild Kristensen is studying public communication at NTNU, and is one of the founder of this party, concerned over the underrepresentation of young people as elected officials. She is the chief of communication in Studentpartiet. She contacted us because the party needed a web site. As a public communication student, she has much knowledge of how to communicate to the public much efficiently. Therefore, she has made several <a href="#requirements">specific requirements for the website.</a> We will have communication with her throughout the project.</p>

            <div class="content-box" id="purpose">
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the site is to spread information about Studentpartiet and it's political views, in order to get public support. It is also to make the audience more familiar with Studentpartiet's politicians. In other words, this page is primarily for people who might consider to support the party, and not the party's supporters themselves, however, the site is also for making supporters able to donate to the party and making them able to join the party. The voter participation rate is much lower for young adults than the overall population. This site is also for trying to make young people engage in politics in general, as that would mean a lager focus on student's interests.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-box" id="audience">
                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p>Studentpartiet's primary audience is students, who are usually quite young (often between 18 and 30) and experienced at using the web. Therefore having a modern and appealing appearance is prioritized over accessibility. Also young people surfing on the Internet, often use a short period of time on each web site, therefore it is important to make the party's main political objective promoted on the front page, so that people who are just having a short visit get an intuition of the party's political views. Young people also usually use updated browsers, something that makes CSS-compability issues quite unlikely, but it is important for Studentpartiet that it is a party for everyone, and not just young and modern people, as many in the public would probably support Studentpartiet's pro-academic views, even if they are not a part of academia themselves. Social media is quite important for young people, this site's main demographic, therefore it is important that the site links to Stundentpartiet's accounts on social media, and ask visitors to follow them. It has proven harder to get young people to the polls than the population overall, which makes it important that this site also promote activism, and not just educate the audience about Studentpartiet's views.</p>
