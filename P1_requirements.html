                        <p>The party was founded this year.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Why:</h3>
                        <p>Students getting tired of not having their voices heard.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Who:</h3>
                        <p>The party is pro-academia and has students as their main target demographics, but is open for everyone with pro-academic political views.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Why a website:</h3>
                        <p>The party is positioning itself for the next election and needs a website to make their political views easily available to the public.</p>

                    </li>

                        <p>Make the visitors more familiar with Studentpartiet's politicians.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Who are they:</h3>
                        <p>Studentpartiet's primary audience is students, who are usually quite young (often between 18 and 30) and experienced at using the web.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>What are the consequences:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Having a modern and appealing appearance is prioritized over accessibility.</li>
                            <li>Young people surfing on the Internet often use a short period of time on each website, therefore it is important to make the party's main political objective promoted on the front page, so that people who are just having a short visit get an intuition of the party's political views.</li>
                            <li>Young people also usually use updated browsers, something that makes CSS-compability issues quite unlikely.</li>
                            <li>Social media is quite important for young people, this site's main demographic, therefore it is important that the site links to Stundentpartiet's accounts on social media, and asks visitors to follow them.</li>
                            <li>It has proven harder to get young people to the polls than the population overall, which makes it important that this site also promotes activism, and not just educate the audience about Studentpartiet's views.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li>Studentpartiet's main political objectives should be shown on the frontpage.</li>
                    <li>The website should have a practical menu in the header, that is, linking to the most used sites (front page, political program, supporting page and the contact page).</li>
                    <li>The site design is based upon an orange color, because it is Studentpartiet's political color.</li>
                    <li>The site should use photos of happy people (that may lead to the audience mentally connecting the party with positivity).</li>
                    <li>The contact information should be easily found, by having contact information in the footer and link to the contact page in the navigation bar.</li>
                    <li>The site should have a way to join and to donate to the party.</li>
