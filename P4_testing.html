        <h2>Test document</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Google forms:</h3>
                <a href="#">A link to the Google Forms we used.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Age, gender, is student or not, etc.</h4>
                        <p>First of all was the demographics, so that we could know who were answering the survey.</p>
                        <p>For the live testing we used students, who are the main audience for the page.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Did you get an intuition of what Studentpartiet's political views are?</h4>
                        <p>First of all, the main purpose of this site was to spread Stundentpartiet's political views, therefore that was the first question.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Did you like the page design?</h4>
                        <p>It was important to Studentpartiet that the page looked modern, therefore that was one of the main questions.</p>
                        <p>The live test group liked the design. But they tought some parts could have been done better. The political program page could have been informing the user that you could select one party and one case. One user thought it was wierd that we had Political programs at the top of the page AND at the nav bar. They also tought the nav bar bar was way to big and annoying that they had to scroll. The linking from the main page was good. Mobile users thought the timeline was a little bit hard to read.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Did you find what you were looking for?</h4>
                        <p>It is important that the navigation is intuitive for the user.</p>
                        <p>No live users had any problems navigating on the page. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Did you miss anything?</h4>
                        <p>Users may look for other information about political parties, that wasn't thought of.</p>
                        <p>No live users had anything in mind.</p>
                    </li>
