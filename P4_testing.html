        <h2>Live testing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Age, gender, is student or not, etc.</h4>
                <p>For the live testing we used students, who are the main audience for the page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Did you like the page design?</h4>
                <p>The live test group liked the design. But they thought some parts could have been done better. The political program page could have been informing the user that you could select one party and one case. One user thought it was weird that we had Political programs at the top of the page AND at the navigation bar. They also thought the navigation bar bar was way to big and annoying that they had to scroll. The linking from the main page was good. Mobile users thought the timeline was a little bit hard to read.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Did you find what you were looking for?</h4>
                <p>No live users had any problems navigating on the page. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Did you miss anything?</h4>
                <p>No live users had anything in mind.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Test document</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Age, gender, is student or not, etc.</h4>
                        <p>First of all was the demographics, so that we could know who were answering the survey.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>(Scale) What was your first impression of the page?</h4>
                        <p>The first impression is important, because that cause a sudden like or dislike in people.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Did something catch your attention?</h4>
                        <p>Studentpartiet's main political objectives were supposed to be in focus, and this is a way to see if they actually were.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>(Scale) Was it easy to compare the parties? *</h4>
                        <p>It is important that it is easy to compare the parties, because all of Studentpartiet's opinions are on this page.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>(Scale) How easy was it to donate money? *</h4>
                        <p>Donating money is an important function as that is supposed to be Studentpartiet's main funding source.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>(Scale) How easy was it to get more information about the party? *</h4>
                        <p>This question both test the site's navigation structure, and if people are able to find information, which is useful as people probably have never heard of the party before.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>How easy was it to find and read about the history of the party? *</h4>
                        <p>Same as above.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>(Scale) What are your final impression of the site?</h4>
                        <p>This makes us able to see if users like or dislike the page more than they did by the first impression.</p>
                    </li>
                        <h4>Final thoughts?</h4>
                        <p>This makes us able to see if users have any relevant comments that doesn't suite well under the other categories.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p>* = on these questions, users were asked if they had any comments as well.</p>

        <h2>Reflections on the test results.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Front page and first impression:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Points:</h4>
                        <p>We got an average of 3.2 points on a scale from one to five.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>What we made right:</h4>
                        <p>The main objective for the front page was to emphasize the party's main political objectives. Several people listed them as their first impression, which makes us believe that this goal was achieved.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Possible improvements:</h4>
                        <p>A common response was that the site was too wide, especially on big screens, therefore i think we should have used e.g. max-width or tried to make the site more responsive to big screens, where we didn't pay much attention when we designed the site.</p>
                        <p>Some people commented that links weren't highlighted enough on the site, and that we would probably should have links in a different color.</p>
                        <p>Some people commented that two navigation structures were unnecessary. It is possible that we should have kept us to have just one of them. One person also commented that the button for the navigation bar was hard to find, and that it's icon should have been larger</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Hard to solve/insolvable problems:</h4>
                        <p>There are different opinions here. Some people commented that the page was good because it was simple, others commented that the site was bad because it lacked there wasn't enough information on each site. We can't make everyone happy here.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <h3>Political comparison:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Points:</h4>
                        <p>We got an average of 3.5 points on a scale from one to five.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>What we made right:</h4>
                        <p>Several users commented that the comparison was easy to use, which was important to us.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Possible improvements:</h4>
                        <p>Many people commented that it was hard to distinguish the issues and the parties, specially on mobile. Some also commented that it would be great if we labeled them after what they were used for. This means that we should have grouped the issues and the parties properly so they were easily distinguishable.</p>
                        <p>Some people complained also here, that the page was too wide, which means we should have used a max-width or similar.</p>
                        <p>One person also commented that we should emphasize the differences more, instead of just showing their opinions. But that would go against the objective which was an neutral comparison. If Studentpartiet wrote the difference, their bias would probably influence how the text is written, instead of letting other parties talk for themselves.</p>

                        <h4>What we made right:</h4>
                        <p>The high score implies that the donation process was easy.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Possible improvements:</h4>
                        <p>One person commented that it would be possible to donate any amount, not just the options on the page.</p>
                        <p>One person commented that users should have a way to double check the information before they are sent, when they register as a member of the party.</p>

                        <h4>Possible improvements:</h4>
                        <p>Several commented that the information on the about page was too limited, and even that they got more information about the party on the front page. This means we should put more information on this page.</p>
                        <p>One person commented that the textbox went out of the screen on the mobile page, which should be fixed.</p>
                        <p>One person commented that nothing was centered on the page, but the intended design was centered, which means that this should be as well.</p>

                        <p>The score was slightly better for final impressions than first impressions, something that implies that the design is dragging our score down. This suites well with all the comments criticizing the page design.</p>

        <p>
            The actual coding with html, css and javascript was ok (was a bit hard at times, at least css), but what might be the hardest part about the project was to design the webpage to make it look pretty (that's probably why companies have a designer to designer and coders to code). This project really taught us how much documentation and planning that goes into a project (even a small one like this) and how hard it can be to coordinate tasks to team members. Especially how to finish tasks that has to be done before you can start on another task. Overall it was a decent learning experience.
