        <h2>Page Layout</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Color scheme:</h3>
                <p>The background color of the page is very light gray, because it is important that the background doesn't steal to much of the audience's attention.</p>
                <p>The standard font color is going to be dark gray. It's not quite black and white, because we wish to reduce contrast, so that you wouldn't be weary of reading. By going standard black and white, the design won't steal people's attention, and it gives a modern minimalistic appearance.</p>
                <p>The navigation bar, buttons and icons will be in orange, because that is Studentpartiets political color, and the page will remind people of them.</p>
